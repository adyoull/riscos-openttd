# SDL 2.26.0 RISC OS overlay (authoritative copy)

**This directory is the master copy of the overlay.** riscos-openttd (and
any other project) uses a copy of it made with
`tools/sdl-overlay-export.sh DEST_DIR`, which also writes a `SOURCE` file
naming the riscos-mesa commit. Changes are made here, in riscos-mesa, and
then copied out; a change needed by another project comes here as a
request (a handoff), not as an edit to its copy.
`tools/sdl-overlay-check.sh DIR` reports whether a copy still matches.

One set of per-file patches, GCCSDK autobuilder style (`patch -p0`, any
order). The GL code is in these files, and the configure option decides
whether it is compiled:

- **riscos-mesa** (`build/build-sdl2.sh`) configures with
  `--enable-video-riscos-osmesa`: libSDL2 with OpenGL / OpenGL ES through
  OSMesa.
- **riscos-openttd** configures the same files without that option:
  libSDL2 with no GL code at all (no OSMesa needed to link).

It contains:

- OpenTTD's Wimp driver: desktop windows, icon bar icon + Quit menu,
  full screen single tasking, typing, eig caching, direct-to-screen full
  screen framebuffer (from openttd-riscos-buildkit.tgz).
- Fix 13: stay a Wimp task in full screen (no Wimp_CloseDown), become a
  task at VideoInit when the desktop is running, Wimp_SetMode instead of
  OS_ScreenMode while a task. Re-applied here from the OpenTTD port's notes;
  reconciled with riscos-openttd commit 9d90de1 (the same code).
- OpenGL via OSMesa (`SDL_riscosopengl.[ch]` + small hooks), compiled only
  with `--enable-video-riscos-osmesa`. Desktop GL 2.1, and (2026-09-25)
  OpenGL ES 1.1 / 2.0 with `SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_ES`, which needs
  riscos-mesa's OSMesa patch (`OSMESA_ES1_PROFILE`/`OSMESA_ES2_PROFILE`). Without that flag the library has no
  GL code at all (checked: no GL symbols), i.e. it is the OpenTTD driver.
- Scroll wheel (2026-09-25, from riscos-openttd commit 210ba99): read with
  `OS_Pointer 2` on every poll and sent as `SDL_MOUSEWHEEL`, in a window
  (while the pointer is over it) and in full screen. RISC OS 5 on the Pi
  doesn't send Wimp `Scroll_Request` events. It's in
  `src.video.riscos.SDL_riscosevents.c.p`; `scroll-wheel-only.diff` is the
  same change on its own, against the previous events patch.
- Cooperative multitasking (2026-09-25): nothing in the driver may stop
  other tasks while the program has a desktop window.
  - `SDL_Delay` yields with Wimp_PollIdle (whole centiseconds; the
    sub-centisecond rest is a short busy-wait) instead of UnixLib's
    busy-wait, which froze the desktop. Hook in
    `src.timer.unix.SDL_systimer.c.p`; main thread only.
  - `SDL_WaitEvent`/`SDL_WaitEventTimeout` block in Wimp_PollIdle with null
    events off, so an idle program uses no CPU. While the pointer is over
    the window it wakes every 2 cs to sample the mouse (the Wimp has no
    motion events). `SDL_SendWakeupEvent` sets an RMA pollword.
  - GL vsync in a window paces to the display rate with the same
    cooperative wait; `OS_Byte 19` is only used full screen.
  - Full screen stays single tasking by design (no Wimp_Poll).
- High resolution desktops (2026-09-25, from riscos-openttd commit
  a062b36): in an EX0 EY0 ("180 dpi") mode a desktop window is shown with
  each SDL pixel as 2x2 screen pixels, as a 90 dpi mode would show it, and
  the mouse position is scaled to match. It falls back to 1:1 if the
  doubled window wouldn't fit. `SDL$WindowScale` (1 = off, 2-4) overrides
  it. The plot works out the scale from the sprite's own resolution too, so
  a 90 dpi sprite (non-16M-colour screens) isn't doubled twice. Full screen
  is unaffected. GL windows are scaled the same way (GL renders at the
  window's SDL size).
- The program's own name and icon (2026-09-25): the task name, icon bar
  sprite and icon bar menu title come from the program's application
  directory. A program run as `...!TestGL2.!RunImage` is "TestGL2" in the
  Task Manager and the menu, and its icon is the `!TestGL2` sprite if the
  Wimp sprite pool has it (the Filer or `IconSprites` in `!Run` loads it),
  otherwise the generic `application` sprite. `SDL_HINT_APP_NAME` (or the
  `SDL_APP_NAME` variable) overrides the name. Every desktop program now
  gets an icon bar icon with a Quit menu.
  - This replaces the global `SDL$IconSprite` variable, which isn't read
    any more. Once OpenTTD had set it, every SDL program run afterwards
    showed OpenTTD's sprite and name. OpenTTD's own icon is found the new
    way (`!OpenTTD`), so its `Set SDL$IconSprite` line is now unnecessary.
  - Before, the task name was always "SDL", because Wimp_Initialise
    happened before any window title was set.
- Sound (2026-09-26, from riscos-openttd commit a34e9bd): a RISC OS audio
  driver, `src/audio/riscos/SDL_riscosaudio.[ch]`, playing through the
  RISC OS 5 SharedSoundBuffer and StreamManager modules (over SharedSound),
  so SDL programs' sound mixes with other programs'. S16 stereo at the
  program's rate (SharedSoundBuffer resamples); about 60 ms queued; the
  audio thread sleeps rather than spins while the queue drains. It comes
  before SDL's `dsp` driver; if the modules aren't loaded it declines, and
  SDL falls back to `dsp` (UnixLib's `/dev/dsp` over DigitalRenderer).
  Registered by `sdl2-configure.ac.riscosaudio.p`,
  `include.SDL_config.h.in.p`, `src.audio.SDL_audio.c.p` and
  `src.audio.SDL_sysaudio.h.p`; configure reports
  `Audio drivers : disk dummy oss riscos`. Programs' `!Run` files should
  RMEnsure SSound, StreamMan and SSBuffer (see ports/sdl2-tests `!LoopWave`).
- Quitting from the desktop (2026-09-27, requested by riscos-openttd;
  written from the PRM/ROOL documentation):
  - Message_PreQuit (the Task Manager's Quit, or a desktop shutdown) is
    acknowledged, which stops the quit, and SDL_QUIT is posted so the
    program can quit its own way (confirm, save). For a desktop shutdown
    (flag bit 0 clear), when the program then quits, the shutdown is
    restarted with a Ctrl-Shift-F12 key press (Wimp_ProcessKey), before
    Wimp_CloseDown or at exit. Only if it quits within 30 s of the PreQuit
    and not by the icon bar menu or close icon, since SDL can't say
    whether the user answered "yes": quitting later, after "no", must not
    shut the desktop down.
  - Message_Quit posts SDL_APP_TERMINATING and SDL_QUIT; if the program
    takes them and carries on, the driver calls SDL_Quit and exits, as the
    Wimp requires.
  - The close icon sends SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE (SDL posts SDL_QUIT for the
    last window unless SDL_HINT_QUIT_ON_LAST_WINDOW_CLOSE is 0); the icon
    bar menu's Quit still sends SDL_QUIT.
  - SDL_ShowWindow / SDL_HideWindow open and close the desktop window
    (it reopens where it was); SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN leaves it closed.
  - `SDL_riscoswimp.h`: the Wimp blocks the driver uses as structures
    (window state, redraw, pointer, caret/key, message...), from the PRM
    layouts with compile-time size checks, instead of int arrays with
    numeric offsets. The conversion changes no code (checked on the
    compiled objects).
  - Tested by `tests/host-harness/sdl-wimp`.
- `sdl2-configure.ac.host.p`: OpenTTD's triplet fix (arm-riscos-gnueabihf
  is not Linux). `sdl2-configure.ac.osmesa.p`: the OSMesa option.

The older `sdl2-riscos-framebuffer.p` from the buildkit is superseded by
`src.video.riscos.SDL_riscosframebuffer.c.p` and must not be applied.

These patches change SDL files, so they are under SDL's zlib licence, like
the files they change (including the new SDL_riscosopengl.c/.h, which
carry SDL's notice). The rest of riscos-mesa is MIT: see LICENCES.txt.
